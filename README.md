Multithreading allows a program to execute multiple tasks concurrently within a single process. This enables better performance and responsiveness, especially on multi-core processors. It's crucial for handling tasks involving a mix of computation and I/O operations. However, it introduces challenges like synchronization and thread safety, which need to be carefully managed. Mastering multithreading is essential for developing high-performance applications.

```python
import turtle
from multiprocessing import Process
```
