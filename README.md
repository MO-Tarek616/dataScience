  Multithreading allows a program to execute multiple tasks concurrently within a single process. This enables better performance and responsiveness, especially on multi-core processors. It's crucial for handling tasks involving a mix of computation and I/O operations. However, it introduces challenges like synchronization and 
thread safety, which need to be carefully managed. Mastering multithreading is essential for developing high-performance applications.

```python
import turtle
from multiprocessing import Process
```

  ### Turtle library
  The Turtle library in Python provides a simple graphics module for creating drawings and animations. It's beginner-friendly and allows users to control a turtle that moves on a drawing canvas, making it a popular choice for introductory programming exercises related to graphics.
  ### Process class from Multiprocessing
  The multiprocessing module in Python allows you to create and manage separate processes, enabling true parallelism. The Process class is used to initiate new processes. You can start a process with start(), wait for it to finish with join(), and terminate it with terminate().
